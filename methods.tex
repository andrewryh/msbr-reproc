\section{Methods}


% Material and methods 

% Provide sufficient details to allow the work to be reproduced by an
% independent researcher. Methods that are already published should be
% summarized, and indicated by a reference. If quoting directly from a previously
% published method, use quotation marks and also cite the source. Any
% modifications to existing methods should also be described.

% Theory/calculation 
% A Theory section should extend, not repeat, the background to the article
% already dealt with in the Introduction and lay the foundation for further work.
% In contrast, a Calculation section represents a practical development from a
% theoretical basis.
