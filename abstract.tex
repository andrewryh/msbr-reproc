Nowadays climate change pushes humankind in search new ways to generate carbon-free, reliable, nonintermittent base load power. That is reason why interest in advanced nuclear energy and, particularly \glspl{MSR} has resurged, with multiple new companies pursuing commercialization of \gls{MSR} designs\footnote{Examples include both liquid-fueled and solid-fueled molten salt designs from
Transatomic, Terrapower, Terrestrial, Moltex Energy, and Thorcon.}. To further develop these \gls{MSR} concepts researchers need tools for analyzing liquid fueled molten salt reactor depletion and fuel processing. However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-fidelity full-core depletion calculations in an online reprocessing regime. This paper introduces a Python script, SaltProc, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2, and simulates \gls{MSR} online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt. SaltProc capabilities was demonstrated for full-core high-fidelity model of the commercial \gls{MSBR} concept and compared well to previous results from lower fidelity analyses.
