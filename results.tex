\section{Results}

\begin{itemize}
  \item K-eff over 40 years of simulation with $<$15pcm uncertainty.
  \item Dynamics isotope composition from initial to equilibrium composition.
  \item Dynamics of fissile vs non-fissile isotopes over 40 years.
  \item Neutron spectrum for both states and separately for Zone I and Zone II (probably, even Zone II-A and II-B).
  \item Power distribution plot (without breeding, too much pics).
  \item Control rod worth \& Six factor analysis \& temperature coefficients.
  \item $^{232}$Th refill rate.
  \item Bried discussion (2-3 paragraph).
\end{itemize}
