The \gls{MSR} is an advanced type of reactor which was developed at \gls{ORNL} 
in the 1950s and was operated in the 1960s. More recently, \gls{MSR} was 
included in the six advanced reactor concepts that have been chosen by the 
Generation IV International Forum (GIF) for further research and development. 
\glspl{MSR} offer significant improvements ``in the four broad areas of 
sustainability, economics, safety and reliability, and proliferation resistance 
and physical protection" \cite{doe_technology_2002}. To achieve the goals 
formulated by the GIF, \glspl{MSR} attempt to simplify the reactor core and 
improve inherent safety by using liquid coolant which is also a fuel.

 In the thermal spectrum \gls{MSR}, fluorides of fissile and/or fertile 
materials (i.e. UF$_4$, ThF$_4$,  PuF$_3$, TRU\footnote{ Transuranic 
elements}F$_3$) are mixed with carrier salts to form a liquid fuel which is 
circulated in a loop-type primary circuit \cite{haubenreich_experience_1970}. 
This innovation leads to immediate advantages over traditional, solid-fueled, 
reactors. These include near-atmospheric pressure in the primary loop, 
relatively high coolant temperature, outstanding neutron economy, a high level 
of inherent safety, reduced fuel preprocessing, and the ability to continuously 
remove fission products and add fissile and/or fertile elements 
\cite{leblanc_molten_2010}. The thorium-fueled \gls{MSBR} was developed in the 
early 1970s by \gls{ORNL} specifically to realize the promise of the thorium 
fuel cycle, which uses natural thorium instead of enriched uranium. With 
continuous fuel reprocessing, \gls{MSBR} is very attractive to effecively 
realize advantages of the thorium fuel cycle because the $^{233}$U bred from 
$^{232}$Th is almost instantly \footnote{\space $^{232}$Th transmutes into 
$^{233}$Th after capturing a neutron. Next, this isotope decays to $^{233}$Pa 
($\tau_{1/2}$=21.83m), which finally decays to $^{233}$U 
($\tau_{1/2}$=26.967d).} being recycled back to the core 
\cite{betzler_modeling_2016}. The mixture of LiF-BeF$_2$-ThF$_4$-UF$_4$ has a 
melting point of $499^\circ$C, a low vapor pressure at operating temperatures, 
and good flow and heat transfer properties \cite{robertson_conceptual_1971}. In 
the matter of nuclear fuel cycle, the thorium cycle produces a reduced quantity 
of plutonium and \glspl{MA} compared to the traditional uranium fuel cycle. 
Finally, the \gls{MSR} also could be employed as a converter reactor for 
transmutation of spent fuel from current \glspl{LWR}.

Modeling liquid-fueled systems with existing neutron transport and depletion 
tools is challenging because most of these tools are designed for the 
solid-fueled reactors simulation. The fuel material flows and potential online 
separations or feeds of specific elements or nuclides are the main challenges
of liquid-fueled systems. Furthermore, no established tool for liquid-fueled 
\gls{MSR} neutronics and fuel cycle evaluation exist, though internally 
developed tools from universities and research institutions can approximate 
online refueling \cite{serp_molten_2014}. The foundation for these tools was 
based on early \gls{MSR} simulation methods at \gls{ORNL}, which integrated 
neutronics and fuel cycle codes (i.e., ROD \cite{bauman_rod:_1971}) into 
operational plant tools (i.e., MRPP \cite{kee_mrpp:_1976}) for \gls{MSR} and 
reprocessing system design. More recent research efforts in Europe and Asia 
mainly focus on fast spectrum reactor fuel cycle analysis and couple external 
tools to neutron transport and depletion codes take into account continuous 
feeds and removals in \glspl{MSR}. Four of these efforts are listed in 
table~\ref{tab:fs_codes}.

Most of these methods are also applicable to thermal spectrum \glspl{MSR}. 
Additional tools developed specifically for thermal \gls{MSR} applications are 
also listed in table~\ref{tab:fs_codes}.

Liquid-fueled \gls{MSR} designs have online separations and feeds, where 
material is moved to or from the core at specific time steps (batch) or 
continuously. In batch-wise approach the burn-up simulation stops at a given 
time and restart with a new liquid fuel composition (after removal of discarded 
materials and addition of fissile/fertile materials). \gls{ORNL} researchers 
have developed ChemTriton, a Python-based script for SCALE/TRITON which the 
batch-wise to simulate a continuous reprocessing. This tool models salt 
treatment, separations, discharge, and refill using a unit-cell \gls{MSR} 
SCALE/TRITON depletion simulation over small time steps to simulate continuous 
reprocessing and deplete the fuel salt \cite{powers_new_2013}. Methods listed in 
references \cite{fiorina_investigation_2013,sheu_depletion_2013,park_whole_2015, 
jeong_equilibrium_2016,powers_inventory_2014,betzler_molten_2017,rykhlevskii_online_2017} 
and current work employ a batch-wise approach.

Accounting for a continuous removal or addition is more difficult because it 
requires adding a term to the Bateman equations. In SCALE 
\cite{bowman_scale_2011}, ORIGEN \cite{gauld_isotopic_2011} solves a set of 
Bateman equations using spectrum-averaged fluxes and cross sections generated 
from a deterministic transport calculation. Approaches listed in references 
\cite{doligez_coupled_2014,heuer_towards_2014,aufiero_extended_2013,nuttin_potential_2005} 
model true continuous feeds and removals. 

Thorium-fueled \gls{MSBR}-like reactors similar to the one in this work are 
described in \cite{park_whole_2015, 
jeong_equilibrium_2016,powers_new_2013,powers_inventory_2014, 
betzler_molten_2017,rykhlevskii_online_2017,nuttin_potential_2005}. 
Nevertheless, most of these efforts considered only simplified unit-cell 
geometry because depletion computations for a many-year fuel cycle are 
computationally expesive even for simple models. 

Nuttin \emph{et al.} broke up reactor core geometry into tree \gls{MCNP} cells: 
one for salt channels, one for two salt plena above and below the core and the 
last cell for the annulus, consequently, two-region reactor core was 
approximated by one region with averaged fuel/moderator ratio 
\cite{nuttin_potential_2005}.  A similar approach was used by Powers \emph{et 
al.}, Betzler \emph{et al.}, and Jeong \emph{et al.} 
\cite{powers_new_2013,powers_inventory_2014,betzler_modeling_2016, 
betzler_molten_2017, jeong_development_2014, jeong_equilibrium_2016} and clearly 
misrepresent the two-region breeder reactor concept. The unit-cell or one-region 
models may produce reliable results for homogeneous reactor cores (i.e. 
\gls{MSFR}, \gls{MOSART}) or for one-region single-fluid reactor designs (i.e. 
\gls{MSRE}). A two-region \gls{MSBR} must be simulated using a whole-core model 
to represent different neutron transport in the inner and outer regions of the 
core, because most fissions happens in the inner region while breeding occurs in 
the outer zone.  

Aufiero \emph{et al.} extended the Monte Carlo burnup code SERPENT 2 and 
employed it to study the material isotopic evolution of the \gls{MSFR}. The 
developed extension directly takes into account the effects of online fuel 
reprocessing on depletion calculations and features a reactivity control 
algorithm. The extended version of SERPENT 2 was assessed against a dedicated 
version of the deterministic ERANOS-based EQL3D procedure 
\cite{ruggieri_eranos_2006} and adopted to analyze the \gls{MSFR} fuel salt 
isotopic evolution. We employed this extended SERPENT 2 for a simplified 
unit-cell geometry of thermal spectrum thorium-fueled \gls{MSBR} and obtained 
results which contradict existing \gls{MSBR} depletion simulations 
\cite{jeong_equilibrium_2016}.

The present work introduces the online reprocessing simulation code, SaltProc, 
which expands the capability of the continuous-energy Monte Carlo Burnup 
calculation code, SERPENT 2 \cite{leppanen_serpent_2015-1}, for simulation 
liquid-fueled \gls{MSR} operation 
\cite{andrei_rykhlevskii_arfc/saltproc:_2018}. It also reports the 
application of the coupled SaltProc-SERPENT 2 system to the \gls{MSBR}, an 
extension of the work presented in 
\cite{rykhlevskii_full-core_2017, rykhlevskii_online_2017}. In this work, we 
analyze \gls{MSBR} neutronics and fuel cycle to find 
the equilibrium core composition. The additional objective 
is to compare predicted operational and safety parameters of the \gls{MSBR} at 
both the initial and equilibrium states. Finally, $^{232}$Th feed rate will be 
determined and \gls{MSBR} fuel cycle performance will be analyzed.

The complex \gls{MSBR} geometry is challenging to describe in software input, 
and, 
usually, researchers make significant geometric simplifications to model it 
\cite{park_whole_2015}. This study leverages extensive computational 
resources to avoid these geometric approximations in order to accurately capture 
breeding behavior.
